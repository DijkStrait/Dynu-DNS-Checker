# Dynu-DNS-Checker
Simple python code to check the current IP and update it in the dynu dynamic DNS.

For now, there is no installation, i'm planning to create one to automatically add the python code as a service.

To execute this, make sure to have python installed (i'm using version 2.7.16).

Once you have python installed, download both files, the config and the .py and edit the config file:
key: Token created in the website dynu dynamic DNS.
domain: Domain that you want to keep updated.
pool_interval: in seconds, time between the script will check the current IP.

Execute the .py file and that's it!

As you can see in the code, i'm not a pro programmer (even an average one) but i find this code very usefull and easy to edit, 
just feel free to edit it and if you want and it's a good change i will include in the repo :)
